Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- * You can see it on this page : https://checkout-page-master-19cec.web.app
- What was your experience?
- * It was somewhat laborious, since I made a mistake several times, that is the reason for so many DIV tags
- What have you learned/improved?
- * This project is done with HTML, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT. I decided to make the dropdown list based on DIV tags. I must continue to improve since I consider that there are unnecessary labels.
- Your wisdom? 
- * I'm still improving HTML5 , CSS3 ,JAVASCRIPT
